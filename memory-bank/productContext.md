# Product Context - DevTools

## Vision
A native macOS developer toolbox that feels like an extension of the developer's workflow - fast, reliable, and intuitive.

## User Problems Solved
- **Context Switching**: Developers waste time switching between different web tools and applications
- **Offline Dependency**: Many online tools require internet connectivity
- **Performance**: Web-based tools can be slow and resource-heavy
- **Data Privacy**: Sensitive data doesn't need to leave the local machine
- **Integration**: Poor integration with macOS features like clipboard and drag-drop

## User Experience Goals
- **Immediate Access**: Tools load instantly with no startup delay
- **Native Feel**: Leverages macOS design patterns and interactions
- **Dual Navigation**: Access tools via sidebar or visual home page grid
- **Smart Persistence**: Remembers recent operations and user preferences
- **Seamless Integration**: Works naturally with drag-drop and clipboard
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Simple by default, powerful when needed

## Target User Journey
1. **Discovery**: User opens app, sees clean home page with available tools
2. **Quick Access**: User either clicks tool card or uses sidebar navigation
3. **Immediate Productivity**: Tool loads with sensible defaults and recent history
4. **Natural Interaction**: Drag files, paste clipboard content, see live results
5. **Persistence**: Settings and history preserved across sessions

## Success Metrics
- Time from app launch to productive tool use < 2 seconds
- Zero crashes during normal operation
- User returns to app rather than web alternatives
- Positive feedback on native macOS integration
